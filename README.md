# COVID-19-Patient-Management-System

This is a C program designed to handle the registration of COVID-19 patients in a hospital ward. The system records critical data of each patient, including their NIC number, name, age, gender, and admission date. The program allows users to add new patients, delete patients, show information of a specific patient when their NIC number is given, and show information of all the patients in the system. The UI is command-line based.

Please note that the patient management system is volatile, which means that patient data will be lost when the program is stopped. There is no need to write patient data to a file or database.

### Installation

To run the program, simply compile the source code and execute the resulting executable.

### Usage

Once you have compiled and executed the program, you will be presented with a command-line interface that allows you to interact with the patient management system. You can use the options provided to add new patients, delete patients, show patient information, and view all patient records in the system.
